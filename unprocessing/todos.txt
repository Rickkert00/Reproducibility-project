borrowing color correction, white balance, and noise parameters from our iPhone
captures’ EXIF metadata to “unprocess” this data into raw space

TODO:
demosaic (converting to 1 color channel / pixel)
Inverting this step is trivial—for each pixel in the image we
omit two of its three color values according to the Bayer
filter pattern

This consists of inverting, in order,
tone mapping (Section 3.7),
applying gamma decompression (Section 3.6),
applying the sRGB to camera RGB color correction matrix (Section 3.5),
and inverting white balance gains (Section 3.4)
and digital gain (Section 3.3)
